### Conclusions and Comparisons

1. Budget Allocation and Student Performance
The district's 15 schools have a combined budget of $24,649,428, highlighting a strong commitment to educational funding. Despite this considerable investment, a comparison of average performance metrics reveals a notable disparity between subjects. The average reading score is 81.88, whereas the average math score is 78.99, showing that students tend to achieve better results in reading than in math. This disparity suggests that additional resources or targeted interventions may be needed to enhance math education and boost math scores to be more comparable with reading performance.

2. Passing Rates Comparison
A detailed analysis of the passing rates shows that 85.81% of students pass reading, whereas only 74.98% pass math, indicating a significant 10.83% difference in performance between the subjects. This disparity highlights that students perform better in reading compared to math. With an overall passing rate of 80.39%, which averages the passing rates of both subjects, it is evident that most students are performing satisfactorily. However, the lower math passing rate suggests a need for improvement. These insights could prompt strategic decisions to reallocate funds or introduce specific programs to enhance math proficiency and align it more closely with reading performance.
